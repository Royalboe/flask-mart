My professional experience working in the Nigerian health industry made me realize some gaps in the utilization of data and the flow of information. This problem starts from the data collection phase and extends to its use. Further research revealed that this is a common trend in developing nations. I believe the first steps are to improve the ways we collect health-related data, prioritize digitizing the data as opposed to our current practices of paper-based record keeping, and optimize security and safety. Only then are we on the right path to use data to gain actionable insights that improve health outcomes in developing nations. My goal is to leverage data and technology and introduce the best practices to the Nigerian health industry. The Ph.D. program in biomedical and Health Informatics would provide me with the required research skills and experience to contribute to this effort.

My education and professional experience so far have prepared me for graduate school. My undergraduate training in physical therapy had a significant basic medical, clinical, and research curriculum. There I took related classes including computer appreciation, medical biostatistics, and research methodology. I spent the last eighteen months in physical therapy school conducting research by testing the usability of a virtual gaming system as a therapeutic for people with low back pain. This undergraduate dissertation was later published in a peer-reviewed journal. I have since been a licensed physical therapist in Nigeria and I have worked in various settings. I improved skills like clinical reasoning, working with patients, and information dissemination in a multidisciplinary team. Additionally, to further prepare myself, I took relevant online courses in computer science, programming, and cloud technology.
 
In the quest for further knowledge on using Information technology and Communications(ICT) to reduce inefficiencies in the healthcare system, I decided to pursue a Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. My objectives for the Ph.D. program are to develop experience and perform cutting-edge research in health information systems by integrating my experience and skills as a clinical physical therapist and a software and cloud developer. I believe that appropriate big data management, analysis, and interpretation, as well as computer science capabilities, will drive and improve the efficiency of the healthcare system. My research focus will be on the use of artificial intelligence to manage health records, highlight errors in treatments, and reduce workflow inefficiencies. I will use the knowledge and skills from graduate studies alongside my existing experience as a physiotherapist to develop user-friendly software that not only optimizes data collection and information processes but apply knowledge-based system processing to efficiently utilize the data collected to reduce inefficiencies surrounding decision-making, thereby providing the best management to the patients.
